- Access to the git log
    - how to identify different builds? 
    
    - what info is needed for parsing?
        -> author ?

Questions: 
1. Only run against master? 
2. What will trigger this script? 
    - Triggered by commit? or merge or build? 

3. Can you describe the input/output of this script? 

4. What does approved changes to master mean? 

5. What if there are more than 1000 failures, how shall i deal with it.  


Workflow 

Triggers Script ?? -> Build X -> parse git log for commit,commiters,message ->execution complete -> build number -> lookup test results from situation room based on build numbmer

2 parts: 

Part 1 (Before execution): 

-> Takes in the Build number 
-> Gather info from git log based on Build number 
    - commit 
    - commiters 
    - message etc 

Part 2 (Execution Completes)

-> Takes in the Build number 
-> Look up for failed test results via situation room based on Build number


   

Output
-> Commiters + List of failed test results
